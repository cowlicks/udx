UDX is reliable, multiplexed, and congestion-controlled streams over UDP. Originally designed for use with  [hypercore](https://github.com/holepunchto/hypercore). Based on the original implementation in [C here](https://github.com/holepunchto/libudx).

## Concept

* Readable code for documentating the protocol
* Fully tested against the C library
* Usable through Rust FFI from any language
